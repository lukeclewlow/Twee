We wanted to build a web page that would get relevant top trending tweets from London and speak them out loud! Full credit to Danielle for a wonderful idea that I was very happy to be involved with!

Objectives
-----
* Create a proof of concept
* Learn about API's, specifically Twitter's in this case
* Learn how to use voice synthesis

Technologies
----------
* Ruby
* Sinatra
* Twitter API
* Html
* CSS
* Git

MVP Requirements
---------------
- [x] Get tweet data from Twitter
- [x] Filter it by top trending results
- [x] Have the webpage speak them out loud

Enhancements
------------
If we had more time to work on this project, the features we would like to have added would be:
- [ ] The ability for several tweets to be spoken simultaneously
- [ ] CSS Styling and Design - A tree with birds seemingly saying the tweets without any text visible on the page
- [ ] More structured filtering of data

## Synopsis

This is an mvp of a larger idea that explores the rate of information dissemination through the use of social media. 

The idea is to build our own tower of Babel using real time information from the twitter API. 

In it's current instantiation, our app can pull tweets based on the top five trends in London, and we read those tweets using the voice api built into the browser. 

We would like to expand this idea and have multiple voices simultaneously reading multiple different tweets in different languages.

## Technologies Used

- Sinatra
- Ruby
- Javascript
- html
- css
- TESTING SUITES
  -rspec
  -jasmin

## Collaborators

- Josh Bebbington (https://github.com/bebbs)
- Luke Clewlow (https://github.com/lukeclewlow)

## Still to complete/refactor

- add multiple voices
- add more attractive front end

## Takeaway

As a team, this was our first experience working with an API of any kind. It was also our first opportunity designing a project where we could decide for ourselves which technologies to use (in terms of the text-to-speech API). We discovered that and initial code spike is integral for this process, as it gave us the opportunity to experiment with different approaches and different technologies. Once we had a successful spike, it gave us the confidence to build a fully tested mvp.
