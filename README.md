#The Tweet of Babel

We wanted to build a web page that would get relevant top trending tweets from London and speak them out loud! Full credit to Danielle for a wonderful idea that I was very happy to be involved with!

* Learn how to use voice synthesis

Technologies
----------
* Ruby
* Sinatra

* Javascript
* Jasmine
* RSpec
* Html
* CSS
* Git

MVP Requirements
---------------
- [x] Get tweet data from Twitter
- [x] Filter it by top trending results

Enhancements
------------
If we had more time to work on this project, the features we would like to have added would be:
- [ ] The ability for several tweets to be spoken simultaneously

Danielle: "As a team, this was our first experience working with an API that pulled in information of any kind. It was also our first opportunity designing a project where we could decide for ourselves which technologies to use (in terms of the text-to-speech API). We discovered that an initial code spike is integral for this process, as it gave us the opportunity to experiment with different approaches and different technologies. Once we had a successful spike, it gave us the confidence to build a fully tested mvp."
